# Austin's Kafka Practice
This repo contains the work I did following the Kafak tutorials provided by [https://www.confluent.io](https://www.confluent.io).

## Modules
The project contains a few different modules, each of wich is a solution or exploration into a particular cornerstone of Kafka, i.e. Consumers, Producters, Streams, etc.

## Execution
Because this work was mostly for my own eduction and exploration, it may not run on your machine. I tried to programatically solve the issue of creating topics using the Admin library built by Confluent and so the Confluent platform would need to be installed locally for this to run.
